# 🌟 Unilomio: A little help for the lonely journey

Hey there, I'm **Rashika**! 👋

I'm just a solo founder who's been there. Late nights fueled by ☕ coffee, staring at the code, and wondering if any of it is even worth it. The truth is, building something from scratch can feel incredibly lonely. I know what it's like to struggle, to feel like you're the only one going through it. 😔

That's why I started **Unilomio** 💜. I didn't just want to build plugins; I wanted to build lifelines. A small, simple tool that could take one thing off another founder's plate so they could focus on what truly matters. It's my way of reaching out and saying, _"You're not alone in this."_ 🤗

## 🎯 Why Unilomio?

It's a lifesaver for founders who want to showcase their products in a new, engaging way. You can easily add beautiful, interactive 3D visualizations to your website without spending a ton of time or money on complex development. It's all about making your life easier and helping you tell your product's story more effectively. ✨

## 💸 Pricing Philosophy

My plugins are super cheap, and some are even **FREE** 🎁. The small charge is really just for sustenance, to keep the lights on and the code flowing. It's enough to help me keep going so I can keep helping others.

## 💖 A Personal Note

The work I do is deeply personal, a piece of my own journey. So, while I'm thrilled you're using it 🎉, I'd really appreciate it if you respected my [licensing terms](https://licensing.unilomio.in). It means a lot to me that you respect the effort and heart poured into this. 🙏

## 🆘 Need Help?

If you have a special need or want to customize a plugin for your specific use case, don't hesitate to reach out. I'm here to help! You can always email me at support@unilomio.in 📧.
